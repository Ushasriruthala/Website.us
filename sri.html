It helps the farmers ensure greater profitability through direct farmer to buyer communication and also farmer to farmer communication. It provides transparency in the system. It enables easy and fast communication. This innovative site allows for good farmer, retailer and supplier communication. It allows farmers to login and communicate to respective dealers. The farmers may also submit their grievances and complaints to respective dealers or authorities using their farmer login on a separate complaints page(blog) and authorities will get access to that page regularly using their login id and passwords. The farmers can sell their products directly.<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the project, It contains an admin side where he/she can manage all the agricultural and farming records. The admin plays an important role in the management of the system. In this project, the admin has full access to the system.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This web project provides following features: Separate login areas with appropriated functionality for farmers, administrators and dealers/retailers. A separate page where only farmers can post complaints and only assigned administrators can read and edit this page. Pages where dealers and retailers may post their ads and notifications. An effective GUI so that rural people may easily use the service. Can be over for multiple villages to communicate and deal with each other. Farmers can directly contact retailers suppliers by searching online. Farmers may submit their grievancesÂ online.

This is severe in developing countries in africa and asia. Predicting and Diagnosing Cardiovascular disease to ensure appropriate treatment of the disease. The correct prediction prevent life threats and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. There are instruments available which can predict heart disease but either it is expensive or not efficient to calculate chance of heart disease in human. Machine learning plays a major role in processing the automatic systems. Machine learning can be used to detect the hidden patterns without the human intervention. The Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine are used to predict whether the people have a chance of getting Cardio Disease or not, but prediction of Cardiovascular disease is most difficult task because many algorithms perform limited operations. The aim of the project is to increase the accuracy and prediction values.

                This project aims to address the challenges faced by traditional broadcasting methods by proposing a state-of-the-art solution using AWS Elemental Media Live and AWS Elemental Media Package. 
                Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) cameras have played a pivotal role in this revolution, offering broadcasters a dynamic means of capturing and transmitting high-quality video in real-time. 
                The traditional approach to live streaming often involves dedicated hardware, which can be costly to set up and maintain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspThis project involves the implementation of live streaming from an RTMP camera using AWS services, specifically AWS Elemental Media Live and AWS Elemental Media Package. This integrated solution offers a reliable and scalable platform for delivering high-quality live video content to a global audience. It includes adaptive bitrate streaming, security, scalability, monitoring, cost efficiency, and high availability. AWS's infrastructure plays a crucial role in supporting robust and efficient media workflows, making it an necessary resource for streaming applications.
